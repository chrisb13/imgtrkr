# imgtrkr v0.1
Python library for adding and reading useful metadata to png files. 

This is so I can remember how I created a plot!

============
This software has only been tested on Linux and only for python 2.x.

Using Git clone the package to a local folder of your convenience...
```bash

```
If you don't have Git, click on 'download zip' on the top right of this page and extract to a folder called 'imgtrkr'.
